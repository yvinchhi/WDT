<p>My dog sasha is my best friend. she like to  chose the soccer ball when
    I paractice it is so funny to see her runnning down the field trying to catch her with mouth. it just won't fit 
    </p>
    
<p>
    once sasha saved my life when i was only 4 years old I started go on the street to get the ball that had rolled across the street . 
    ofcourse I didn't think to look for cars ! sasha    got in front of me and knocked me backward on the sidewalk i was made untill i 
    saw the car go by where i would have been then i was so happy that sasha was so smarter than i was.
