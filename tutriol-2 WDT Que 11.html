<p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an
        empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but
        he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few
        things in the box.<br>
<br>
        Jack would really like...</p>

<ul align="left" >
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic trick</li>
        <li>Anything pokemon</li>
        <li>A motorised lego set</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p > You can get all this (and more) at an online toy
store. Two very popular ones are <a href="bing.com">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="youtube.com">etoys.</a></p>
